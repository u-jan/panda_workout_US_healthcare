The US famously has the most expensive healthcare system in the world.
Study after study shows that while costs for the same course of treatment vary widely between hospitals,
patient outcomes are generally not correlated with these costs.
Compounding this problem is the fact that healthcare treatment and cost data are notoriously difficult to interpret.
So most people do not consider costs when seeking treatment.
However, you as a data scientist are much better equipped to do so than an average consumer.
Where would you seek treatment?
